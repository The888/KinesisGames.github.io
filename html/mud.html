    Instead, the Project files of Mud 2 will be used and modified. The Characters will be redesigned,
    current game modes will be made better with more new game modes to be added.</p>

    more things to do in gen2 worlds, more in-game objects and new environments (both gen1 and gen2).

    <h4 class="mud2-p2 dis3" style="margin-top: 10%;">Changelog from the original MUD:</h4>
    <p class="mud2-p2">Finally Mud 2 is released. First of all, I would like to apologize to everyone who had played
    the original Mud and who faced all the issues. Everything is fixed now. The Menus have been re-designed,
    the buttons and text elements have been made bigger, new Soundtracks from NCS have been added in all the game
    modes and menus. To overcome the issues due to lag, the worlds/cities have been broken down in even smaller
    worlds/cities. Due to this change, the game Graphics has been improved. Also, more worlds/cities have been
    added. Now coming to the fixes in the game modes:</p>
      <ul class="mud2-p2">
        <li><u>UI</u> :All the buttons and text elements have been fixed and placed well. The radar and the minimap
            are fixed in all the game modes and the minimap can be toggled on or off.</li>
        <li><u>Characters</u> :The Character in the Third Person Controller mode has been made more handsome.
            The robot and cat in the city of Mud also have been improved. The Cat's name is Mordi by the way.
            In the First Person Shooter mode, everything is fixed and you can now shoot with 4 different guns.
            "Gun Cycling" and "Shoot" buttons have been added too. The FLY game mode has been fixed and you
            can go up or down with the help of buttons. Also, there is a "Boost" button because the character
            doesn't go fast while flying.
        <li><u>Land Vehicles</u>: The "Gear" text has been removed and the "Speed" text has been made bigger.
            The Tank can Shoot giant bullets. Green Dream was removed.</li>
        <li><u>Airplanes</u> A text has been added so that you can keep track of your Altitude helping you to
            fly better.</li>
        <li>In the latest update, there is a Camera button in the game modes of Land Vehicles and Airplanes.
        Touch this button to toggle between the chase camera and the first person view camera. Also,
        giant invisible walls have been added to the all of the game modes except in the game modes of
        Airplanes, so don't get trolled.</li>
      </ul>
