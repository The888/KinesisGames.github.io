      <p class="member_p2" style="color: SkyBlue;">As you may already know, I am a programmer and a developer!
                                                   I was long fascinated with tech. As a kid I would download ROMs
                                                   for my NDS and in my early teenage years, root phones (loved hacking games).
                                                   
                                                   <br><br> One day, I decided to learn programming because I wanted to do cool stuff and
                                                   impress kids :v. I learnt Python and Pygame and was really into videogame making.
                                                   I attempted a lot of courses on SoloLearn and Udemy and later on, learnt to
                                                   make games using the Unity game engine. It took me months to learn unityscript (C#)
                                                   and the many features that Unity offered. I continued learning and develop games in my
                                                   free time.
                                                   
                                                   <br><br> After a while, I had learnt a lot of stuff! I knew how to flash ROMs on mobile
                                                   phones and use some Windows Applications to recover deleted files or have fun with
                                                   partitions for example. As far as Unity was concerned, I was managing to finally write
                                                   unityscript well. I also understood how to use some of its various features such as
                                                   Animations, Colliders, Particle Systems and UI Stuff.
                                                   
                                                   <br><br> One day, I was done with Windows. I could no more stand how it kept on lagging
                                                   and made me wait for basic operations such as a right-click on a file. So, I dual booted
                                                   Linux Mint, as being an Android fan and user, I loved customisation. I flashed other
                                                   distros but Mint has remained my favourite since. I learnt how to use the terminal and wrote
                                                   custom commands to improve my workflow. I also bought a Raspberry PI and learnt how to
                                                   setup vnc so that I can use it anywhere with a powerbank, my phone's screen and a hotspot!
                                                   
                                                   <br><br> I participated in the Google Code-In of 2018. It was by far the best activity I
                                                   engaged myself in! I learnt so much in those 1.5 months! I learnt how to ssh, learnt regex
                                                   and even became quite good in HTML/CSS. In no time at all, I was contributing to real life
                                                   projects on GitHub! I had no idea what terms such as vagrant, ansible, isort, flake8, coveralls,
                                                   travis ci, git, markdown, docker images and django tests meant before. I then open-sourced
                                                   some of my projects on GitHub when I understood the importance and worth of Open Source.
                                                   
                                                   <br><br> I have a few more things to say. Firstly, it is never too late to start learning
                                                   and learning never stops. Then, NEVER give up! If other people managed to do it, why
                                                   wouldn't you be able to? Maybe it'll take you hours or years to do that thing but there's
                                                   no reason why with determination you won't be successful. You will perhaps cry and rage a
                                                   lot but when it works, no one will be prouder and happier than you! See y'all!
